## Inspiration ⚡

## Workflow ⚙

## How it was built 👷‍♀️
The product consists of various software subsystems which were combined to make it a complete working prototype. React was used in the front  end of the web application. Firebase was used while authenticating users and Firestore for storing and retriving the key-value pairs. After fetching the data I used chart.js to convert the data into graph to give user a better visual representation. The AR model required AR core, AR Foundation and Unity 3D.And finally the Chrome extension was built in HTML,CSS and vanilla Javascript.
