## Inspiration ‚ö°
Every 3 out of 5 girl and non binary are in a state of depression. The major reason for this is lack of concern for mental health issues, physical harrasment and lack of privacy due to which they cannot share things. Regina is a latin word which means queen I feel everyone should be given the respect and space they deserve. Through my product I tried to solve all the 3 problem to some extent. 


## Workflow ‚öô

## How it was built üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The product consists of various software subsystems which were combined to make it a complete working prototype. React was used in the front  end of the web application. Firebase was used while authenticating users and Firestore for storing and retriving the key-value pairs. After fetching the data I used chart.js to convert the data into graph to give user a better visual representation. The web application is hosted on cloud. The AR model required AR core, AR Foundation and Unity 3D.And finally the Chrome extension was built in HTML,CSS and vanilla Javascript.  

## Challenges with TheRegina ü•∫
The biggest challenge was human emotions are fuzzy numbers which cannot be scaled by linear scaling. To actually know how the person actually in actually feels in a week or a span of month and make the graphs actually research ready we need servers which are fast and database which can hold huge amount of data. Scaling human emotion on a scale from 1-5 is just an approximate and probabilistic approach to know how girls and non binary actually feel.Talking about the AR part including more moves and animating them on blender will make the model large and difficult to render on usual runtime making it difficult to place the product for production. 


## What's next for TheRegina üëë
Currently TheRegina is terms of snopping data breeches only makes Google meet secured the chrome extension can be extended other social media platforms and apps as in Microsoft teams , Discord and more. TheRegina fitness trainer hosting on cloud to make the rendering fast and quick. The web application emotion scaling after proper research on the number can be either scaled up to more emotions or scaled down to less. Social media share buttons will be added so that people can share their graphs showing their happiness index.
